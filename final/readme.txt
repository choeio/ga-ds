Candidate Data

This repo contains data and code for the General Assembly's Data Science final project. The data is a sample of 10,000 rows from approximately 250k rows of information on users. This data, as well as more data to come, will be used to study the demographics and usage of LiveCareer's resume building tool.

The data was stored in a MySQL database before being loaded into R for minor cleanup and visualization.
